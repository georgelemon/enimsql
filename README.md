### 👑 Discover Nim language
<strong>What's Nim?</strong> Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula. [Find out more about Nim language](https://nim-lang.org/)

<strong>Why Nim?</strong> Performance, fast compilation and C-like freedom. We want to keep code clean, readable, concise, and close to our intention. Also a very good language to learn in 2022.
